- Reached out to Brandon a few times since 4am PST to start site wrap-up- Brandon kept telling me they were close to finishing- Over an hour later and he's been cleaning up, performing cable mgmt, and cutting the ceiling tile to accomodate the cabling- Requested he check with MOD that all systerms are online and to provide the requested rack photos- There were 3 FSTs onsite tonight but we lost some time with the laptop
