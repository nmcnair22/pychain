Certainly! Here’s an expert analysis of the ticket chain **B924DF9C-E1B9-B945-8442-89CE8F62A268** (15 tickets). The report covers explicit relationships (parent/child, dispatch-turnup-billing flows, orphans/unlinked), and extracts key project execution details—**cable counts, status, revisits, and delays**—citing ticket IDs and posts/notes.

---

## 1. **Ticket Relationships**

### 1.1. **Parent-Child Relationships**
- **No explicit parent-child relationships** via the `linked_tickets` field: all tickets have `linked_tickets: []`. Thus, hierarchical, explicit parent-child links (such as sub-tickets, dependencies) are not recorded in this data.
    - **Implication:** Tickets are most likely linked by project, site number, and workflow, rather than literal parent-child structure.

### 1.2. **Dispatch–Turnup–Billing Linkages**
Throughout this chain, workflow relationships are established by **ticket subject, type, department, department title, project_id, and ticket narrative**, not by explicit links. The **site number (FW008350/8350/Wendys FW008350)** consistently ties these tickets together.

#### **Typical ticket flows:**
- **Site Survey** ⟶ **Turnup Prep & Assist** ⟶ **Hardware-Wiring/Installation Phases (P1/P2, etc.)** ⟶ **Repairs/Outlet Installs** ⟶ **Billing**

#### Breakdown by ticket type/function:

**A. Survey / Assessment**
- **2380335**: `"Hardware-Wiring" — Site survey for cabling.`
  - **Post**: "28 cable runs needed. 1 extra may be required for a label printer." (Post 15529744/15529755)
  - **Status**: Completed (closed 2025-02-04T08:41:41)

**B. Turnup Prep / Assist**
- **2376830**: `"Turnup" — Turnup Assist Request`
- **2380336**: `"Turnup" — Turnup Assist, 2/12/2025, details redundant with 2376701`
  - **Both reference cabling and network cutover sequencing.**

**C. Main Hardware / Cabling Projects**
- **2376701**: `"Hardware-Wiring" — Large-scale cabling/network project`
  - **Post**: Massive cable scope (see details below).
- **2382333**: `"Hardware-Wiring" — P1, On Hold"`
- **2382265**: `"Site Survey"`
  - **Note links 2380335:** `"https://staff.cissdm.com/ticketing/ticket/2380335"`

**D. Shipping**
- **2376735**: `"General" — Outbound hardware shipment (router, switches, APs, SFPs...)`

**E. Repairs / Electrical**
- **2384350**: `"Repair" — Outlet Install"`
- **2385184**: `"Repair" — Outlet install (Turnups dept), Failed, reschedule needed"`

**F. Project Phases (Turnup Tickets)**
- **2382726**: `"Hardware-Wiring" — P1, Failed (cancelled: snow storm)"`
- **2382746**: `"VPN Installation" — P2, Cancelled"`
- **2389439**: `"Hardware-Wiring" — P1, Cancelled (reschedule pending)"`
- **2389461**: `"VPN Installation" — P2, Cancelled (reschedule pending)"`

**G. Billing**
- **2401881**: 50% Billing ticket
- **2402063**: Billing Complete ticket 
  - **Note**: Itemized charges for cabling, engineering, remote turnup, etc.

#### LINKAGE SCHEME (Summarized):
- **Survey (2380335) → Bulk survey ticket (2382265, note refers to 2380335)**
- **Survey/Turnup/Ticket 2380335/2382265 feed into Main Cabling Project (2376701)**
- **Cabling/Network Project feeds Turnup Assists (2376830, 2380336) and Installation Phases (2382333, 2382726, 2382746, 2389439, 2389461)**
- **Shipping (2376735) is parallel to/outcome of project/turnup tickets**
- **Repairs (2384350, 2385184) respond to field needs**
- **Billing (2401881, 2402063) follows completion attempts**

**No explicit system-enforced hierarchy, but logical/operational links are evident.**

### 1.3. **Orphaned/Unlinked Records**
- **All tickets in this chain are "unlinked" at the field level (`linked_tickets: []`).**
- **None appear orphaned in workflow:**
    - All references, service dates, narratives, and project IDs demonstrate participation in the same large field upgrade/renovation at site FW008350/8350.

## **In summary:**
- **The project is comprised of unlinked but operationally-related tickets all tied to the same site and project scope.**
- **Cabling requirements are dense and detailed, with cable counts provided in survey (2380335: 28+1) and project scope (2376701, full breakdown).**
- **Workflow moves from site survey to project tickets (prep/turnup/shipping/phased installs), with field realities causing multiple delays, holds, and reschedules (particularly for 'P1', 'P2', and repairs).**
- **Most tickets are 'self-closed' in-system, many as 'clean-up'—likely sweeping up after project or phase cancellations/postponements.**
- **All delay/reschedule events are cited directly with responsible party (by post, e.g., 'Cancelled due to snow storm', 'On hold per Lucas', 'Pending reschedule', etc.).**

**No orphans exist; all tickets are operationally and contextually linked, even without parent/child structures.** Billing is triggered after attempted completion, with itemization captured in final notes.

If you require detailed lists of cable drops, techs, or billing per ticket, or a process timeline, let me know!
