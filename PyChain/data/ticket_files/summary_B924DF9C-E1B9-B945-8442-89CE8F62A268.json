  "summary": "Certainly! Below is a comprehensive analysis of relationships, workflow linkages, and extracted implementation details across the provided ticket chain (**hash B924DF9C-E1B9-B945-8442-89CE8F62A268**) for site FW008350 (Wendy\u2019s Hagerstown, MD). The analysis covers parent-child structures, workflow flows (dispatch/turnup/billing), and key project execution details extracted from posts and notes.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Parent-Child Relationships**\n- **No explicit parent-child relationships** are established in this dataset via the `linked_tickets` field (all are empty arrays).\n- **However**, strong *logical* parent-child relationships exist, inferred from subjects, project IDs, and posts:\n  - Site Survey \u2192 Cabling/Build project \u2192 Turnup/Dispatch \u2192 Billing\n  - Phasing also present (P1, P2, etc.)\n\n---\n\n## **2.
