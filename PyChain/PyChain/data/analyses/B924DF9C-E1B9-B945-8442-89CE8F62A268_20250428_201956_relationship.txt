Certainly! Here’s a structured analysis of the relationships and extracted details among the **15 tickets** in chain hash **B924DF9C-E1B9-B945-8442-89CE8F62A268**, focusing on parent-child links, workflow transitions (Dispatch—Turnup—Billing), orphans, and extracted cable/drop/scheduling details.

---

# 1. **Parent-Child Relationships (via linked_tickets)**
- **All tickets** in this chain have **empty `linked_tickets` arrays**.
- **Conclusion:** No explicit parent-child relationships are declared *via system links*; tracking is by chain membership and subject, not by system-defined linkage.

---

# 2. **Workflow Linkages: Dispatch ↔ Turnup ↔ Billing**

### **Dispatch / Initial Scoping**
- **2376830:** "Turnup Assist Request" — *Dispatch* setup for remote resource, mentions network cutover and check-in requirements.  
  - **Closed** Feb 6 (post: "Closing as clean up efforts of 2/6/2025").
- **2382265:** "Site Survey" ("Flat Rate") — Survey completed post (Feb 7): "Survey completed 2/4, Tech info: Joel (240) 888-7239".
  - Note: Links to main survey ticket 2380335.

---

### **Site Survey / Scope / Prebuild**
- **2380335:** **MAIN SURVEY** — Scope detailed, explicitly notes:
    - **"28 cable runs needed"**
    - "1 additional cable run may be required for a label printer."
    - "2 racks to be installed."
    - "A power outlet is needed at the new rack location."
    - "Obstructions: No obstructions identified."
    - "ISP Circuit: Technician was unable to locate the ISP circuit. Further investigation may be required."
  - **Completed** status, post includes confirmation of checked-in/out times and technician name ("Joel, 240-888-7239").

---

### **Hardware Procurement & Shipping**

---

### **Project Hardware and Turnup Phases**

#### **Phase 1**
- **2382333:** "P1" — Scheduled for 2/11/25 at 9:30pm, multiple techs listed.
  - *Post says*: "On hold per Lucas" (note). **Status: On Hold**.
- **2382726:** "P1 2/11/2025" for 6:30pm. Actual attempt:
  - "Lead Tech - Aaron Blackburn 215-771-8788"
  - *Cancelled due to snow storm*
  - **Status: Failed**; scheduling was disrupted.

- **2389439:** "P1 2/24/2025 6:30 PM", again with "Aaron Blackburn". **Status: Cancelled - CIS ("pending reschedule")**.

#### **Phase 2**
- **2382746:** "P2 2/12/2025" *Technician info not specified, status: Cancelled - CIS*. Note says: "NPC name in MX portal for ARP: 6614".
- **2389461:** "P2 2/25/2025", "Aaron Blackburn", **status: Cancelled - CIS**, post: "Pending reschedule".

#### **Outlet Install**
- **2384350:** "Outlet Install", *Scheduled*.
- **2385184:** "Outlet Install 2/13/2025 5:00 AM", actual tech: "Dahan Electric", contact: "240-603-8778".
  - *Failure post:* "Reschedule will be needed for tomorrow. Time to be determined later tonight."  
  - *Multiple FST attempts to check in—no answer. Failed status.*

---

### **Billing / Close-Out**
- **2401881:** "50 PERCENT BILLING"; request to invoice for "PO: 232498. Amount: 2808"—*billing begins*.
  - Moved to accounting for initial 50% up front.

- **2402063:** "Billing Complete Ticket; Remaining 50%", PO: 232499, amount: 2808.
  - **Note gives a breakdown of billing:**
    - "$2,508.00 Full cabling sites - 3 night model ($5016+$460)"
    - "$460 for P3"
    - "$75 Site survey"
    - "$25 Engineering/PM"
    - "$200 Remote turn up services"
    - **Total: $3,268.00**

---

# 3. **Orphaned / Unlinked Records**
  - Everything is only related by site, subject, and chain; **no formal system linking** (no `linked_tickets`).
  - Orphan records:
    - **2384350:** "Outlet Install", scheduled, lacks direct posts about outcome—seems separately created.
    - **2376701, 2380336:** Predecessor tickets for cabling and turnup scopes, closed as "clean up"—effectively *orphaned* after new phases/scheduling.

---

# 4. **Extracted Details by Ticket**

## **Cable Drop Counts / Rack Info (by Ticket):**

- **2380335 (Main Survey):**
  - **28 cable runs needed**
  - **1** label printer run (possibly needed)
  - **2 racks to be installed**
  - "**Qty. 4** – Siemon Cat 6 Non-Plenum Cables" repeated for multiple locations (see initial post content)
  - Power: *"Power outlet needed at rack location"*
  - *All devices to be cross-connected and labeled/tied down as per standard*

- **2376701 & 2380336:** Also include full cable SOW—quantities for data, menu boards, manager, POS, kiosks, prep, etc.

## **Completion Status / Delays**

- **2376830, 2376701, 2380336:** **Closed** as part of "clean up efforts of 2/6/2025" or "ticket is part of clean-up" (see posts from Josh Bosen/Rachel Salinas).
- **2380335:** **Completed**—Survey finished, work/notes #cited in post by Ryan Cohen.
- **2382726, 2385184:** **Failed** due to weather, missed technician check-in, reschedule required.
- **2382333:** **On Hold per Lucas** (note).
- **2389439, 2389461, 2382746:** **Cancelled - CIS**; site pending reschedule per posts by Alyssa Philpott ("site is pending reschedule... update your schedule accordingly").
- **2401881, 2402063:** **On Hold** for billing, with explicit requests to invoice.
- **2376735:** **Delivered**—hardware arrived, confirmed by tracking & recipient.
- **2382265:** **Confirmed** (site survey done, cross-references main survey 2380335).

## **Revisit Requirements / Delays**

- **2385184:** "Reschedule will be needed for tomorrow" (post by Robert Cohen 2/13/25).
- **2382726:** "Cancelled due to snow storm"—no site work performed yet.
- **2389439, 2389461, 2382746:** "Pending reschedule," awaiting client/site direction.

## **Other Notable Details**

- **2376735:** Tech/hardware configuration details, including MAC addresses, S/Ns, shipping/firmware.  
- **2382726:** Posts include full ARP table ready, potential for tech/dispatch handover future referencing (Robert Cohen).
- **Clock times given** for survey/tech checks (check-in/check-out), useful for verifying field operations.

# **Consolidated Observations**
- **No system-enforced parent-child linkage (no `linked_tickets`)**; *all relationships inferred via site, subject, project*.
- **Workflow is standard field service:**  
  1. **Dispatch and Survey:** Tickets 2376830, 2382265, 2380335 initialize and scope the field work, providing quantity, rack, and outlet needs.
  2. **Hardware Procurement/Shipping:** 2376735, confirming BOM/hardware deliveries.
  3. **Active phases (P1, P2):** 2382333, 2382726, 2389439, 2382746, 2389461 cycle through multiple scheduled/cancelled install attempts, repeatedly “On Hold” or “Cancelled” due to site, weather, or customer timing issues.
  4. **Outlet Install:** 2384350/2385184 scheduled and attempted, but 2385184 ultimately required a reschedule.
  5. **Billing:** 2401881, 2402063 sequentially bill 50%, then 50%, as the project moves to close-out.

- **Orphaned or duplicate tickets** arise from project management transitions ("clean up" of older records as new phases supersede them).
- **Delays and reschedules** are frequent: weather (snow storm), site not ready, technician not notified, missed check-ins.

## **Summary Statement**
> The chain represents a **full project workflow from site survey and dispatch, through hardware procurement, phased installations, and billing** for a network upgrade at a single site. While system-level parent-child relationships are not used, relationships are deduced from project phases and posting patterns. Delays—particularly weather and site-readiness—required multiple scheduling resets, and several records were closed as project management "clean up." Billing was bifurcated into initial and final 50%, with detailed cost breakdowns and explicit cross-ticket referencing for survey records.

Let me know if you need further extraction (such as a component-by-component cable table, or tech contact reference list)!
