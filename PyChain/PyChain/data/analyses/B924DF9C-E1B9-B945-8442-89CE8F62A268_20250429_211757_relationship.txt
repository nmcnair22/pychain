## 1. Parent-Child Relationships

**Observation:**  
- **linked_tickets** field is **empty for all tickets**.  
- **Result:** There are **no system-defined parent-child links**; relationships must be inferred by sequence, subject similarity, ticket type, site number, post content, and notes.

## 3. Orphaned or Unlinked Records

**All tickets are "orphans" by system definition** (no linked_tickets). However, relationships are clear by timeline and subject:

- **2376701** ("Project Management"): Standalone but refers to global site plan.
- **2380335** (Site Survey): Next-step result from 2376701.
- **Contractor/failure tickets** (e.g., 2382726, 2385184): Represented as failed/cancelled tasks; their only linkage is temporal/functional.
- Billing tickets (2401881/2402063): Not explicitly linked in-system, but clearly reference the same site/project—corroborated by subject, PO, and project ID.

### **Relationships Overview**

- The project follows: **Design/Scope → Survey → Shipping → Field Install Attempts (many failed/split by weather, on hold, cancelled, reschedule needed) → Billing**.
- **All records are functionally related but system-orphaned (no linked_tickets).**
- **Posts and notes** clarify status, delays (weather, shipping, tech confusion), revisit needs (reschedule, on hold), and completion.
- **Cable drop counts and technical detail** are present in multiple, especially “plan/scope” phase tickets, consistently quoted in all kickoff and survey tickets.

---

## ***Key Insights for Field Service Management:***

- **No explicit parent-child links:** Process flow must be interpreted from ticket content and subject lines.
- **Survey tickets (2380335, 2382265) drive scope and schedule.**
- **Real-world delays:** Shipments delayed, failed turnups due to weather or resourcing, frequent need for rescheduling.
- **Tickets for each project phase are sometimes closed as "clean up" or "part of audit" instead of explicitly linked.
- **Billing explicitly references project completion milestones.**

**References for specific content:**  
See post IDs and note IDs cited above; cable counts in posts 15500936 (2376701), 15529682 (2380335), 15529683 (private), and others. Closures and reschedule requirements are always documented in post texts as quoted.
