Certainly! Here’s an **in-depth analysis of relationships and extracted post/note details** for the ticket chain **15AF838E-5411-C44E-B4D4-CF4E76E02B76 (18 tickets)** beginning with **2367830**.

---

## 1. Parent-Child Relationships (using `linked_tickets`)

- **linked_tickets** fields are **empty for all tickets** in this chain.  
    - **Implication:** There are **no explicit parent-child relationships** recorded in the system database among these ticket records, i.e., no tickets are formally ‘linked’ as parent or child.

---

## 2. Dispatch / Turnup / Billing Linkages

### a. **Project Structure & Primary Types**

- This project involves:
    - **Turnup/installation/project tickets** (network/cabling work)
    - **Site Surveys (Dispatches/Field Service)**
    - **Revisits and incomplete work**
    - **General problem/monitoring/billing**
    - **Shipping** (hardware)
    - **Formal Billing/Accounting tickets** (client/FST, cost details)

#### **Turnup/Core Project Tickets**
- **2367830** (Project Management, main cabling/network upgrade, Audit)
    - **2374738** (Turnup Visit 1, Hardware-Wiring)
    - **2376373** (Turnup Visit 2, Hardware-Wiring, cabling/install ongoing)
    - **2377027** (Turnup Visit 3, Hardware-Wiring, more install)
    - **2378430** (Day 2 Cutover, Hardware, successful cutover)
    - **2391754** (Revisit 4, VPN Installation—cabling corrections, unresolved work)
    - **2401728** (Revisit 5, VPN Installation—final corrections, closure)

#### **Site Surveys / Dispatch Tickets**
- **2382228** ("FW005579_Fishers_IN_Electrician") — assigned as "Closed", billing $0 customer, $488.19 FST
- **2384454** ("Revisit 1") — referenced closeout notes in 2378430
- **2387576** ("Revisit 2") — closed, revisit not needed
- **2391200** ("Revisit 4") — Audit, $801 FST cost, billing confusion, moved to audit
- **2401701** ("Revisit 5") — Audit, $821.77 FST cost, revisit pricing
- **2424333** (Site Survey, "Closed", $380 FST cost, client billing ticket 2401704)
- **2424336** (Electrician Client Billing—closed, $600 bill to customer, processed on 2382228)

#### **General / Support / Billing Tickets**
- **2381165** ("Billing") — instructs accounting to initiate billing after successful cutover
- **2381460** ("Comcast Modem") — addresses modem config issues post-cutover
- **2382162** ("Add to billing") — confirms site addition to CIS monitor, instructs to invoice appropriately

#### **Shipping Ticket**
- **2368088** — Hardware shipment, ultimately not used (client shipped hardware themselves)

---

### b. **Mapping Ticket Workflows**

#### Turnup/Dispatch-to-Billing Pathways

- **Field Service/Install (Turnup/Survey) → Completion → Billing/Accounting**
    - **Example:**  
        - *Turnup installs (2367830, 2378430, 2377027, 2391754)* &rarr;  
        - *Site survey tickets (2382228, 2384454, etc.)* &rarr;  
        - *Billing triggered by 2381165, 2382162, and finalized in 2382228, 2424333, 2424336.*

#### Billing/Accounting Activity
- **2381165** (“Please initiate billing for this location. Thank you.”, post by Tony Dinh, 2025-02-05)
    - Response: “Added on ticket 2382162” (Kayla Gonzalez, 2025-02-17)
- **2382162** (“Added to billing.” — shown as completed, closes the accounting loop)

#### Survey/Turnup–Audit
- **2378430**: Field install, then moves to audit for review per last post (2377027, 2378430).
- **2382228**: Billing ticket for “Electrician”, invoice to FST, references “Billing to the client will be completed on 2401704” (possible typo for '2401701' or related client billing).

#### Revisits & Incomplete Work
- **2384454** references “closeout notes in 2378430” (post, 2384454).
- **2391754** and **2401728** (Revisits 4/5): Document the process of repeatedly returning to the site for corrections/materials and final punchlist items.
- **2391200** and **2401701**: Track audit status and repeated invoices (one $801, one $821.77), with submitted and later rescinded invoices—see posts by Brandon Mahoney.

---

### c. **Orphaned / Unlinked Records**

- **All tickets have empty `linked_tickets`.**
    - However, functionally, some (e.g., 2368088, hardware shipping, and 2381460, modem issue) **stand alone** and are referenced elsewhere by post content, not formally linked.

---

## 5. **Summary & Observations**

- **All tickets** are **unlinked in system data** but **logically related** via subject, post references, and chronological dependencies.
- The workflow is **sequential**, with install/turnups, escalated field corrections (revisits), audit, and then billing/accounting closure.
- **Revisits** are frequent, necessitated by:
    - Hardware/labor issues (rack, power, dropped cables, material shortages)
    - Scheduling conflicts (sites not closed, hardware delays)
    - Final punchlist items (NVR drops, patch cables and color clips, AP terminations)
- **Delays** are called out explicitly in posts (e.g., “did not ship”, “needed larger back board”), as are requirements for further revisits.
- **Billing confusion/invoice issues** is present, with corrected bills and zero-cost to customer entries, as well as client/FST cost tickets.
- **Material requirements** repeatedly cited: e.g., “25 patch cables, 8 blue clips...”, “10 blank inserts”, leading to two revisits for final closure.
- **Final closure** is only truly achieved after Revisit 5 (2401728), with all installation, corrective, and material tasks done and sign-off received.

---

### **In Summary**
- The entire chain is a **single, evolving project** for network upgrade/cabling at Flynn 5579/Fishers/IN, with dispatch, install, support, revisit, and billing all manifesting as discrete, unlinked ticket records.
- **Posts and notes** contain the true “thread” binding the records, with explicit cross-references (e.g., “see closeout notes in 2378430”) and shared project context.
- **Cable drop counts, completion, revisit, and delay details** are documented in first posts and subsequent technician/PM notes, with ticket IDs and post dates provided in this summary.

If you require visualization (e.g., a workflow diagram) or deeper drill-down into any individual ticket’s chronology or field-work specifics, let me know!
