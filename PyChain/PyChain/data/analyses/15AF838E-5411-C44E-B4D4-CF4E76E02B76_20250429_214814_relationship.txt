Certainly! Here is a comprehensive summary of relationships and extracted details across all 18 tickets in chain **15AF838E-5411-C44E-B4D4-CF4E76E02B76** (starting with ticket **2367830**), as well as an extraction of project specifics per ticket as requested.

---

## 1. **Parent-Child Relationships**
- **linked_tickets** field is **absent or empty across all tickets**. No explicit internal system parent-child linking exists in this chain.
    - All relationships must be inferred from ticket context, subjects, project_id, site_number, and references in posts/notes.

---

## 2. **Dispatch ↔ Turnup ↔ Billing Linkages**

**General Structure and Flow:**
- This chain ties together a single site rollout (Flynn_5579_Fishers_IN) with hardware shipping, turnups (install visits), dispatch revisits, site surveys, billing, and closeout activities.

### **A. Shipping / Pre-Install**
- **2368088** — _Shipping Ticket_: Handles hardware shipment to site. Ticket closed when hardware was determined not shipped ("client shipped the hardware themselves").
    - **Completion Status**: "Closed"
    - **Delay**: Hardware not shipped by the service provider—note says "factory reset...using hardware for another location".

### **B. Turnup / Install / Cabling**
- **2367830** — _Project Management_: Master ‘Hardware-Wiring’ project ticket, long SOW with specific **drop counts**.
    - **Cable Drop Counts**: 
        - Enumerates per-location cable details, i.e., "Install Qty. 1", "Qty. 4 – Siemon Cat 6..." for each device/location.
    - **Status**: "Audit", not yet closed.
    - **Revisit Requirements**: Several posts reference confirmation of follow-up dispatch if not completed (see 2374738 post by Devin Leatham, 2025-01-28).

#### **Turnup and Field Visits**
- **2374738** — _First Survey Visit_: "FIRST VISIT SURVEY ONLY – 1/23/2025".
    - **Cable Drop Counts**: Mirrors 2367830 (full SOW repeated).
    - **Completion**: "Completed"
    - **Details**: 36 cables on patch panel; 30 patched to switch; 24 showing lights.

- **2376373** — _Second Visit 1/27_: _Night cabling run/partial install_; opened as "Cabling and Network Upgrade".
    - **Delays**: Outlets missing; rack backboard undersized; scheduling issues with techs; no photos; cable drops needed access.
    - **Completion**: "Incomplete"

- **2377027** — _Night 2 (1/28/2025)_: _Backerboard install, more cabling, rack install, terminations_
    - **Delays**: Tech had to source own laptop; issues with conduit/cabling removal; patch panel terminations dependent on removing old cabling.
    - **Completion**: “Completed”

- **2378430** — _Cutover Night (2/4/2025)_: _Finalizes install, device brings up Fortinet stack_
    - **Cable Drop Counts**:
        - Repeats required faceplates: (3) black jack; (3) 4-port faceplates; (55) blanks for patch panel.
    - **Delays**: Store closing delays; support required for NAT/passthru on Comcast modem.
    - **Completion**: “Completed”
    - Next revisit needs for photos, cable abatement, and additional install items.

### **C. Revisit & Closeout Iterations**
- **2382228** — "Electrician": Site survey closed after work. Posts show "Billing to client will be completed on 2401704".
    - **Billing Link**: Expenses transferred to dedicated billing ticket (**2401704**).
    - **Completion**: “Closed”

- **2384454**, **2387576**, **2391200**, **2391754**, **2401701**, **2401728** etc. — _Revisit Tickets_:
    - Each is linked only by site and sequence (with 'Revisit 1', 'Revisit 2', etc.), **not by system links**.
    - Revisit reasons:
        - Missing closeout photo set (see 2387576, 2025-02-17, "make a revisit 2 to ‘get complete closeout photo set’").
        - Missing/incorrect installs (materials uninstalled, color clips, abatement, etc.).
        - 2391754 and 2401728 both reference needs for patch cables, clips, AP terminations.
    - **Delays**:
        - Shipping/material shortages (no color clips, missing blanks/plates).
        - Scheduling with tech.
        - Site operation—night work, stores closing late.
    - **Status**: Some 'Closed', some 'Audit', some 'Completed', several marked 'Incomplete' with explicit post for what is pending (see 2391754 posts by John Box, 2025-03-07, listing dozens of needed patch cables and color clips).

### **D. Survey & Billing**
- **2424333, 2424336** — FST Accounting (~Final Billing): Both contain explicit posts describing “A bill was created under this ticket…” with $ values for customer and to internal org.
    - **Reference**: 2424336 is specifically labeled “Electrician Client Billing” and refers back to 2382228 for invoice.

- **2382162, 2381165** — Accounting tickets handling “Add to billing”, "Initiate billing", confirm monitoring and completed install.
    - **Linked by site/project references only**.

---

## 3. **Orphaned/Unlinked Records**
- **No explicit system-parent/child** links (“linked_tickets”: []) across the tickets.
- **Orphaned Tickets**:
    - All are "orphans" in the technical field system linking sense, as no linked_tickets are present.
    - **Relationally**, they tie back to project_id "3912" and site_number "5579" and are cross-referenced in posts (e.g., 2424336 post: "FST invoice was processed on CIS ID 2382228").

## **Summary Conclusion**

- **Tickets are not explicitly linked**, but are functionally **related as a time-sequenced project chain** by project_id, site_number, subject, and cross-reference in posts.
- **Dispatch → Turnup → Revisit → Billing** structure is clear, with billing tied back to installation/dispatch tickets by reference.
- Most tickets **reflect the need for multiple revisits** due to site availability, missing/delayed materials, incomplete cable drops, or photo documentation issues.
- **All delays and requirements are tightly documented in posts** (e.g., color clips, patch cables, ARP tables).
- **Completion status is generally up to date**, with open items clearly called out for remaining materials or documentation; final revisit marks project as "Completed."
- **No tickets are orphaned in a project sense**, but all are system-orphaned (no system linking) except by context/reference.
