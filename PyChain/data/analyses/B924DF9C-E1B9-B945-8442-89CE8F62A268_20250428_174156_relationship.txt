## 3. **Orphaned/Unlinked Records**
- **All tickets lack explicit linked_tickets** — so the entire chain is **logically linked by project/site**, not by explicit parent/child pointers.  
  - They connect through **references in notes**, subject lines, contractor/technician names, and dates.
- **Notes as cross-link:**  
  - Ticket **2382265 Note**: links to **2380335**.  
- **Implicit linkage:**  
  - Site/customer/PO/date narratives, but not system-enforced.

## **Summary**

- **No system-enforced parent-child links**; relationships are **logical**: cabling/survey → shipping → install/turnup → close-out/billing.
- **Dispatch–Turnup–Billing linkage:**  
  Dispatch/Survey tickets trigger hardware shipping and installs; Turnups (P1, P2) attempt but are canceled/rescheduled due to weather or notification issues; Billing begins after or during these phases.
- **Orphan/unlinked:**  
  All tickets technically unlinked, but references, posts and notes in tickets cross-point.
- **Delays/Reschedules:**  
  Major issue due to weather (cancellation of on-site), reassignments ("wrong tech"), missing notifications to site, multiple phases marked "Cancelled" or "On hold."
- **Completion:**  
  Only **survey tickets and dispatches are marked completed/confirmed; most installs are failed/cancelled or on hold; billing is pending/on hold**.
- **Cable drops:**  
  Most survey/project/scoping tickets explicitly note **28–31 cable runs** with breakdown by category (as above in extracts).
