Certainly! Here’s a comprehensive analysis of the ticket chain hash **B924DF9C-E1B9-B945-8442-89CE8F62A268** (15 tickets) for the Hagerstown MD Flynn (Wendy’s) project. This summary covers parent-child links, ticket function relationships (dispatch-turnup-billing), unlinked/orphaned tickets, as well as key operational content extracted directly from ticket posts/notes.

---

## 1. Parent-Child Relationships

### **Linked Tickets**
- **No tickets** in this chain explicitly use the `linked_tickets` field. All ticket's `linked_tickets: []`. Thus:
  - **No direct parent-child relationships** are configured via this mechanism.
  - The chain linkage is logical/chronological and functional (project phase, ticket type, and content), not strictly parent-child via system links.

- “On hold per Lucas” ([2382333: Note 647142])
- "Pending reschedule. The site has not been notified of the install..." ([2389439, 2389461: Posts 15618298, 15618300])

## 7. Orphans & Unlinked Summarized
- **All tickets are functionally related, but none are system-linked by `linked_tickets`.**
- **No true orphans:** All are part of the project flow for Flynn Wendy’s site FW008350 in Hagerstown, MD.

---

# **Summary**
- **No explicit parent-child ticket relationships.**
- **Functional relationships** are present and follow the sequence: Survey → Shipping → Turnups/Phases → Billing.
- **Cable drop counts** and cabling details are consistently and extensively documented.
- **Multiple failures/delays** due to weather ("snow storm") and scheduling; several **tickets marked "pending reschedule"** or "on hold".
- **Shipping and billing steps are captured.** Hardware shipped late but arrived. Billing broken into 50/50.
- **No orphaned project records**; all tickets directly tied to this workflow, though without formal system links.

If you need a visual (graph) of these relationships or want extracts for only a subset of tickets, let me know!
