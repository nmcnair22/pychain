### Ticket Relationships and Chain Analysis for Ticket ID 2380335

Based on the provided ticket chain, here’s a detailed summary:

---

## 1. **Parent-Child Relationships (Linked Tickets)**

- **Linked Tickets Field Usage:**  
    - All tickets have an empty `linked_tickets` field.  
    - **Conclusion:** There are *no explicit parent-child links* defined between tickets in this chain using this field.  
    - **Implication:** All tickets are *siblings* under the same chain context, likely related by project or site, rather than explicit parent-child relationships.

## 2. **Dispatch – Turnup – Billing Linkages**

**Key Types:**
- **Dispatch / Survey / Shipping:**  
    - `2376830`: Turnup Assist Dispatch (Closed)
    - `2376735`: Hardware Shipping (Delivered)
    - `2382265`: Site Survey (Confirmed)

- **Turnup / Hardware-Wiring / General Project Events:**  
    - `2376701`: Cabling and Network Upgrade Project (Closed)
    - `2380335`: Survey (Completed) [*subject ticket*]
    - `2382333`, `2382726`, `2382746`, `2384350`, `2389439`, `2389461`: Various phases (P1, P2, Outlet Install) with mixed statuses (Failed/On Hold/Cancelled)
    - `2380336`: Turnup Assist 2 (Closed)

- **Billing / Accounting:**  
    - `2401881`: 50% Billing (On Hold)
    - `2402063`: Final Billing (On Hold)

**Linkage Summary:**
- **Dispatch sets up site readiness and shipping (2376830, 2376735)**
- **Site Survey is conducted (2380335, 2382265).**
- **Multiple Turnup/Hardware-Wiring tickets for different phases:**
    - *Phase 1*: 2382333 (On Hold), 2382726 (Failed), 2389439 (Cancelled)
    - *Phase 2*: 2382746 (Cancelled), 2389461 (Cancelled)
    - *Outlet Install*: 2384350 (Scheduled), 2385184 (Failed)
- **Turnup Support tickets may refer to survey results (notes in 2382265 mention 2380335 directly).**
- **Billing kicks in after field activity (2401881, 2402063)—these are sequenced to bill for 50% and then final payment.**

---

## 3. **Orphaned or Unlinked Records**

Because all `linked_tickets` fields are empty, all tickets are *effectively orphaned in terms of direct record linkage*.  
- The only relationship between them is by chain inclusion (i.e., `chain_hash`), `project_id`, and site number.
- However, **notes** in 2382265 (`https://staff.cissdm.com/ticketing/ticket/2380335`) demonstrate a *soft* linkage by explicit reference.
- 2382333's note indicates it's "on hold per Lucas"—a process/people, not system, linkage.
