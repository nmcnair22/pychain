## 3. Anomalies/Issues

**A. Turnup Ticket Orphans/Unfinished**
- **2372208** (Turnup) was never completed (open, no posts). Originally intended to match **2371027**/*2376840* but superseded by later tickets.
- Multiple turnup dispatches created for revisits, but not all resulted in actual site work (e.g., **2413627**: "On hold", two separate 3rd-party billing tickets raised for a single zero-hour event).

**B. Redundancy/Duplication**
- Multiple "Revisit" tickets (both dispatch and turnup) for troubleshooting the same phase/task.
- Several billing tickets for the same event (particularly, two billed at $27 for zero hours for 2413627).

**C. Service Date Ambiguity**
- Many "Service Date" fields are set to the Unix Epoch default (1969-12-31 16:00:00), indicating missing actual date entries on certain records.
- "Site Number" inconsistencies: Sometimes listed as "1840", other times as "FW001840" (should be unified for tracking).

**D. Status/Closure Gaps**
- Original Turnup Assist (2372208) is open but never completed, yet project moved on via other tickets.
- On-hold and confirmed tickets without work completion but with billing entries.

**E. Billing Before/Without Work**
- Final revisit had billing entered even though turnup status is "on hold" (no work actually performed; possibly a cancellation fee).

## 4. Summary: Service History

**Project "Flynn_FW001840_Indianapolis_IN" involved a multi-phase network/cabling overhaul requiring site survey, two main implementation phases (P1: Wiring, P2: VPN Cutover), and several troubleshooting revisits.** Amber Hodgson, Josh Bosen, and Alyssa Philpott were key contacts coordinating between Flynn, field engineers, and external contractors.

1. **Preparation included initial shipping of equipment and the creation of preliminary dispatch and turnup assist tickets.** Shipping occurred ahead of all works and was promptly closed upon delivery.

2. **A detailed site survey was scheduled and successfully completed (with matching dispatch/turnup and third-party billing tickets).**

3. **Phase
