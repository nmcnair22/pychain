I am sounding like a salesman . . . forgive me.   ;-) . . . intentional . . .  \r\n\r\nWe have  installed B2B Networks (e.g. rehabilitation centers, truck stops, et al), fiber backbones in corporate settings (Philadelphia, Baltimore, Harrisburg, etc.), Security System Access Controls such as card readers, mag locks, motion sensors, and security camera installs at fulfillment centers (Proctor and Gamble, Amazon, Geodis, Ryder,  etc.\r\n\r\nWe have performed POS Installations for numerous retail stores and restaurants.\r\n\r\nWe conduct hardware and wifi surveys. \r\n\r\nWe have extensive experience in structured cabling standards (Fiber/Copper) and installations for residences, retail stores, and fulfillment centers. \r\n\r\nWe would love to represent you for this WO!\r\n\t\r\nAnyway, we do everything network related and without the need for REVISITS. I also provide extensive detail-oriented documentation and significant Deliverables of the SOW undertaken and completed. My partner claims I suffer from OCD . . . I may.\r\n\r\nWe perform all of our installs by the industry standards (e.g. TIA/EIA-568), et al.\r\n\t\r\nWe are reliable, experienced, and professional. Please consider speaking with us regarding this opportunity.\r\n\t\r\n    \r\nThanks for your time and consideration. \r\n\r\n\r\nTake care, stay safe and have a wonderful day! \r\nGratitude!\r\n\r\nJohn Monek\r\n(717) 740-7490\r\n\n\n",
