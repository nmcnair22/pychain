# 3. Orphaned or Unlinked Records

Since **linked_tickets** is empty everywhere, **no ticket is formally "parented" or "childed"** by another.  
However, in practical process flow:

- **2376830** is *dispatch parent* initiating project.
- **2376701** is *project parent* describing full scope.
- **2380335** and **2382265** are *survey/report children*.
- **Implementation/turnup tickets** (**2382333**, **2382726**, **2382746**, **2389439**, **2389461**) are *phased children*, each covering distinct attempts or technical phases.  
- **2384350** / **2385184** are *support/outlet installs* related to project needs (i.e., adding required infrastructure per survey or implementation requirements).
- **Billing tickets** (**2401881**, **2402063**) are *project financial outcomes* (typically created after substantial completion).
- **2376735** is *orphaned in structure but functionally part of project*, shipping required hardware.

### **Conclusions**

- **Project is a multi-phase cabling/network cutover with both technical and logistical dependencies.**
- All official relationships are **inferred via chain, subject line, dates, and internal post referencing.**
- **Billing, survey, and implementation tickets each act as functional children or siblings, but not technical children.**
- Numerous **delays and reschedule requirements** due to weather, on-hold situations, and site readiness.
- **Cable drop details** and technical scope are **repeated across multiple survey and project tickets**.
- **No tickets are formally orphaned** in business sense, but several (shipping, repair) are functionally peripheral.

If you need a specific, field-by-field breakdown for each ticket or full post/note content extraction, let me know!
