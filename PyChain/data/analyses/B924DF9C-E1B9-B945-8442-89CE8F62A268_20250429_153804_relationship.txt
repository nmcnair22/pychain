Certainly! Here is a structured summary and analysis of the relationships and extracted details for **all 15 tickets** in chain hash **B924DF9C-E1B9-B945-8442-89CE8F62A268**.

---

## 1. **Parent-Child Relationships**  
**Observation:**  
- **All tickets in this chain have an empty `linked_tickets` field** or omit it entirely.
- **No explicit parent-child (linked) relationships** are defined in these ticket records.

**Conclusion:**  
- There are **no direct parent-child links** via the system's `linked_tickets` field among these 15 tickets.
- Relationships must be inferred through **subject lines, projects, and post content** (see below).

## 2. **Dispatch-Turnup-Billing Linkages**

### **A. Workflow Outline (Project/Chronological Order)**
#### **SURVEY / SCOPING / INITIAL DISPATCH**
- **2376701** – Original project (Hardware-Wiring scope, survey/cabling).  
  - *Cabling/Scope post by Brett Pearson via Triton: lists 13+ cable groups with specific `Qty. X` counts; e.g., "Install Qty. 4 – Siemon Cat 6 Non-Plenum Cables..."*  
  - *Closure: "Closing - ticket is part of clean-up" (Rachel Salinas)*  
- **2380335** – Turnup survey for "Wendys FW008350" site (created by Devin Leatham).  
  - *Scope post itemizes numerous cable drop quantities: e.g., "Install Qty. 4", "Install Qty. 1" for various locations (POS, Manager Station, Kiosk, etc.).*  
  - *Work completed, site survey detailed by Ryan Cohen; closure/completion: "Completed" and "checked in with MOD, Tim, from Wendy’s".*  
- **2380336** – Parallel/similar project management scope for cabling/turnup (David Fisher).  
  - *Same style of scope text ("Legacy Cabling Demo", repeated drop counts, virtually identical to the above).*
- **2382265** – Site survey ticket for "Pro Services".  
  - *Survey completed; notes reference related ticket 2380335: "https://staff.cissdm.com/ticketing/ticket/2380335".*

#### **EQUIPMENT SHIPPING & PREPARATION**
- **2376735** – Hardware shipping ticket (Outbound).  
  - *Lists equipment (1 router, 2 switches, 4 SFP, etc.).*  
  - *Final post: UPS delivery confirmed.*

#### **ONSITE EXECUTION: PHASED TURNUPS**
- **2382333** – "P1" (Phase 1) assigned, but marked "On Hold".  
  - *Tech info included; ticket note: "On hold per Lucas".*
- **2382726** – "P1" scheduled for 2/11/2025, "Failed" due to snowstorm.  
  - *Escalated, reschedule needed, lead tech clarified (Aaron Blackburn).*
- **2389439** – "P1" rescheduled for 2/24, but "Cancelled - CIS".  
  - *Site not notified, pending new scheduling, as per Alyssa Philpott quoting Lucas Berends.*

- **2382746** – "P2" (Phase 2) scheduled, but "Cancelled - CIS".  
  - *Notes indicate ARP/NPC name update, never executed.*
- **2389461** – "P2" also scheduled (2/25), again "Cancelled - CIS".  
  - *Reschedule pending, identical closure as 2389439.*

#### **SUPPORT/RELATED WORK**
- **2376830** – Initial Turnup Assist Request/Dispatch.  
  - *"TURNUP ASSIST REQUEST... please arrange for a remote resource...".*  
  - *Closed during general chain clean-up (Josh Bosen).*
- **2384350** – Outlet Install (Scheduled, status unknown).  
  - *Short post only: "Outlet Install".*
- **2385184** – "Repair" for Outlet Install (actually a Turnup Ticket).  
  - *Failed, due to no answer/check-in and needing reschedule.*

#### **BILLING & PROJECT COMPLETION**
- **2401881** – 50% Billing (On Hold).  
  - *Invoice requested for $2808, PO: 232498 (David Fisher).*

  - *Note details cost structure, matches earlier project amounts.*  
  - *On hold, likely awaiting project wrap-up.*

## 3. **Orphaned / Unlinked Records**

- **All tickets are technically "orphans" in the sense that** _system-level linking is not used here_ (empty `linked_tickets`).
- **Relationships must be inferred from:**
  - Project IDs (most related tickets use 3912 or 3913),
  - Site numbers (FW008350 / 8350 / "Wendy's FW008350", etc.),
  - Cross-references in posts (see note in 2382265 referencing 2380335).

---

## 4. **Extracted Details per Ticket**

### **Cable Drop Counts / Scope Quantities**
Pulled from posts (scopes in survey/turnup tickets):

- **2376701, 2380335, 2380336:**  
  - Each has detailed scope with specific cable quantities (see typical excerpt):  
    - "Install Qty. 1 – Siemon Cat 6 Non-Plenum Cable(s)..."
    - "Install Qty. 4 – Siemon Cat 6 Non-Plenum Cables..." (multiple locations)
    - "Install Qty. 2 – Network switches inside the racks..."
    - Many, many more per ticket/area (see post content for explicit counts per station: WAP, DMB, POS, Kiosk, Prep, OCD, Outdoor DMB, etc.).
  - Total drops explicitly mentioned:
    - **2380335 post ("Survey Notes") – "28 cable runs needed. 1 additional may be required for a label printer."**
- **2376735:**  
  - Hardware/equipment itemization only ("1 router, 2 switches, 2 APs, 1 FEXT, SIM VZW, 4 SFPs GBIC").
- **Other tickets:**  
  - No cable counts (billing, outlet install, billing tickets).

## 6. **Key Relationship Observations**

- **Dispatch→Survey→Turnup Execution→Billing** is reflected **in subject lines and project ID propagation**, not in automated ticket linking.
- **Most tickets are functionally siblings** (referencing same project/site; their only linkage is operational context and post-note cross-reference).
- **Hard linkages, e.g. for parent-child relationships, are notably absent**—systems-level ticket linking is not used; this is a common pattern in certain workflows.

## 7. **Summary of Extracted Details**

- **Cable drop counts:**  
  - Exceed 28 (some duplicated by scope redundancy across phases), see 2380335, 2376701, 2380336.
- **Completion:**  
  - Some surveys/dispatches completed, projects closed in clean-up (closure posts), others on hold or failed due to circumstances (e.g., snow storm, site not notified).
- **Revisit/reschedule:**  
  - P1/P2 phases and certain outlet/work orders explicitly require reschedule (see 2382726, 2389439, 2389461, 2385184).
- **Delays:**  
  - Shipping delays (2376735); turnups placed on hold (2382333), scheduled but not executed (2382746/2389461/2389439 due to external factors); outlet install failed/rescheduled (2385184).
- **Billing:**  
  - Billing split into initial and final 50% (2401881/2402063), both on hold, awaiting project wrap or customer invoicing.

### **Final Note**
To fully reconstruct the operational chain for this site/project, **ticket subjects, post content, and project IDs must be recursively referenced**, as there is no system-enforced ticket linkage.

**Key inferred chain** (by phase):  
**Site Survey / Scope** → **Hardware Shipping** → **Turnup 1 (P1)** → **Turnup 2 (P2)** → **Remedial/Outlet Work** → **Billing**  
**Many execution tickets (P1/P2, outlet install) failed/cancelled or are pending reschedule due to externalities or process issues.**
