Certainly! Here is a structured analysis of the relationships and extracted critical details for each ticket in the provided chain:

---

## 1. Ticket Relationships: Parent-Child, Dispatch, Turnup, Billing, Orphans

### Parent-Child Relationships

- **No direct parent-child relationships** are indicated via the `linked_tickets` field—all `linked_tickets` arrays are empty. This means NO formal ticket linking structure was used; relationships are inferred by subject, project/site, and notes/posts context.

---

### Chain Structure by Functional Phases

#### **A. Project/Survey Phase**
**Tickets: 2376701, 2380335, 2382265, 2380336**
- **2376701**: Project overview for cabling & network upgrade (detailed scope, 11+ cable locations, multiple device types).
- **2380335**: Site survey (2/4/2025). 28 cable runs, 2 racks, power needed; survey completed.
- **2382265**: "Site Survey" dispatch, confirming survey on 2/4/2025 (same as 2380335). 
- **2380336**: Turnup assist for 2/12/2025, citing similar cabling scope as 2376701.

**Relationship:**
- **2380335** and **2382265** are tightly coupled: 2382265 posts reference survey work and final confirmation for site 8350. A note in 2382265 points back to 2380335 for cross-reference (note: `https://staff.cissdm.com/ticketing/ticket/2380335`).
- **2376701** is the project scope “parent;” survey/tickets reference its plan (e.g., survey report in 2380335 references 2376701).

#### **B. Outbound/Shipping Phase**
**Tickets: 2376735**
- Shipping of network hardware: 1 router, 2 switches, 2 APs, 1 FEXT, SIM card, 4 SFPs.
- Posts confirm configuration, shipping delay, eventual delivery on 2/12/2025.

#### **C. Cabling, Repair, Turnup, and Phased Implementation**
**Tickets: 2382333, 2382726, 2382746, 2389439, 2389461, 2384350, 2385184**
- **2382333**: Scheduled “Phase 1” on 2/11/2025, then put on hold (“On hold per Lucas”).
- **2382726**: Attempted turnup 2/11/2025; failed due to snowstorm; lead tech (Aaron Blackburn), rescheduled.
- **2382746**: Planned P2 for 2/12/2025, name in ARP, cancelled.
- **2389439/2389461**: Feb 24/25, 2025, attempts for “P1” and “P2” again, both cancelled with official notice that a new date will be communicated.
- **2384350**: Outlet Install scheduled; duplicate with 2385184.
- **2385184**: Outlet install scheduled for 2/13/2025, failed/reschedule needed ("Reschedule will be needed for tomorrow...").

#### **D. Billing Phase**
**Tickets: 2401881, 2402063**
- **2401881**: Instructs to invoice customer for 50% up front ($2,808).
- **2402063**: Instructs to invoice for "remaining 50%" plus final close out; rate breakdown in the note.

#### **E. Turnup/Closing Phase**
**Tickets: 2376830, 2380336**
- **2376830**: Turnup assist closing post (2/6/2025 clean up efforts).
- **2380336**: Turnup assist ticket: closed as "part of clean-up" (again, 2/6/2025).

---

### Orphaned or Unlinked Tickets

- **No tickets are orphaned by intentional design**—all seem to refer to the same project and phases via subject/site/project fields, but are administratively “unlinked” in the system (empty linked_tickets).
- **Billing (2401881/2402063) and Shipping (2376735) tickets have no explicit linkage to task or project execution tickets** other than shared site/subject.

## 2. Extracted Ticket Details: Cable Drops, Status, Revisits, Delays

Below is a **ticket-by-ticket breakdown** with requested field extractions.

---

## 3. Cross-References, Flow, Orphans

- **Flow:** The project moves from survey/scope (2376701, 2380335/2382265) ➔ shipping (2376735) ➔ scheduled phases (2382333, 2382726, 2382746, etc.) ➔ turnups/repairs, and billing (2401881, 2402063).
- **Orphans:** Technically, all billing and shipping tickets are unlinked administratively but are functionally connected by project/site. No ticket is "orphaned" in the sense of being unrelated.
- **Dispatch–Turnup–Billing Linkages:**
    - **Dispatch/Survey**: Tickets 2380335 (survey) ➔ triggers site survey ticket 2382265 and a set of turnup schedules.
    - **Turnup/Implementation:** 2382333, 2382726, 2382746, 2389439, 2389461 reflect multiple scheduling/failures/cancellations and reattempts.
    - **Billing:** Follows completion (2401881/2402063 directly reference the project and expected split billing, referencing phases).
    - **Closure:** Several tickets are closed as “cleanup” (2376701, 2380336, 2376830).

---

## 4. Highlighted Extracts—Completion, Revisits, Delays

- **Cable Drop Totals:** Explicit in survey and project tickets; e.g., 2380335: "28 cable runs needed," 2376701: specific drop counts per device/location.
- **Completion/Closure:** 
    - **2376830:** "Closing as clean up efforts of 2/6/2025"
    - **2376701, 2380336:** Closed as part of project "clean-up"
    - **2380335:** "Completed" survey; survey post and closure.

# **Key Insights**

- **No explicit parent-child links:** All are functionally related by project/site, but not using system’s linking field.
- **Dispatch–Turnup–Billing linkage flows through project phase/topics:** Surveys → shipping → on-site turnup attempts (some failed, rescheduled, or on hold) → billing.
- **Cabling Scope:** About 28–30 runs per site, often referenced as “Install Qty. X”.
- **Most tickets are closed or pending reschedule due to weather/staffing/notification issues or as project cleanup.**
- **Delays/revisits:** Multiple failed/canceled field efforts (snowstorm, staffing, lack of site notification). Shipping delay. Multiple “on hold” or “pending reschedule” statuses.
- **Billing is split and follows project phases, but functionally not linked in ticketing.**

---
