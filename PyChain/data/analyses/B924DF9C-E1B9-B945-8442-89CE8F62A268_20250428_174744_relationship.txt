Below is a **comprehensive analysis** of the ticket chain B924DF9C-E1B9-B945-8442-89CE8F62A268, focusing on relationships, job flow, specific extracted details, and the status of all 15 tickets. The analysis covers parent-child linkage, workflow between dispatch/turnup/billing, orphans, and key technical details per your request.

---

## 1. Parent-Child Relationships

- **linked_tickets field:**  
  _None of the tickets in this chain explicitly list other tickets in their `linked_tickets` array_: all arrays are empty.  
  **Conclusion:** There are no explicit parent-child relationships based solely on this field. Relationships must instead be reconstructed from subjects, projects, locations, posts, or notes.

## 2. Dispatch–Turnup–Billing Linkages

#### Site: **Wendy’s FW008350 / Hagerstown, MD**

## 3. Orphaned or Unlinked Records

- **No explicit parent/child linkage via `linked_tickets`.**
- **Operational orphaning:** Some tickets reference each other only by notes, posts, or common subject lines (e.g., ticket 2382265’s note referencing 2380335; same for cable scopes).
- **“Clean-up” closure:** Tickets 2376701 and 2380336 were closed en masse, per Josh Bosen/Rachel Salinas, and moved to “Audit.”
- **“Scheduled” but not executed:** Outlet Installs attempted but required reschedule.
- **Phases 1 & 2 (“P1”, “P2”) repeatedly rescheduled or cancelled pending new dates.**

## **Key Workflow Relationships:**

1. **Surveys (2380335, 2382265) feed into main project/cabling/turnup tickets (2376701/2380336, then 2382333/2382726/etc).**
2. **Phased work (P1/P2) was repeatedly interrupted by weather, on-hold, or notification issues.**
3. **Shipping of hardware tracked and confirmed delivered prior to install attempts.**
4. **Outlet installs required for power were not timely completed—prompting separate failures and required reschedules.**
5. **Billing tickets opened with detailed breakdowns, tied to project IDs and POs.**
6. **Some tickets closed as “clean-up” for de-duplication or phase consolidation.**
7. **No explicit system-linked “parent-child” relationships; all relationships are inferred via subject, notes, and timing.**
8. **No completely orphaned records; all tickets fit the project lifecycle, though coordination was problematic (pending, cancelled, delayed).**

# **Conclusion**

- **This ticket chain represents a** multi-phase field network/cabling/turnup project **for a single Wendy’s location.**
- **Project flow follows:** Survey → Shipping → (Cabling) → Install/Turnup (multiple phases, some unsuccessful/cancelled/rescheduled) → Billing.
- **Linked_tickets arrays are empty,** so relationships are reconstructed via context, notes, and posts.
- **Several field tickets were closed for “clean-up,”** reflecting process consolidation.  
- **Hardware was delayed in shipping but ultimately delivered.**  
- **Outlet/power work was a persistent blocker, leading to a rescheduled/repeat attempt.**
- **Repeated delays (weather, communication, holds) prevented final completion of phased work.**
- **Billing opened in two steps as per project/accounting norms,** referencing completed—and even incomplete—field phases.
- **No ticket is a true orphan; all belong to the staged project,** though many rely on informal references for linkage.
