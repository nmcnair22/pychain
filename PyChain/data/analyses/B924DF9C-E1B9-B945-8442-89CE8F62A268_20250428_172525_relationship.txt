## 5. **Other Notable Relationships/Findings**

- **Dispatch-to-Turnup Linkages are inferred** by site numbers, subjects, and datelines—not by formal ticket links (i.e., you must track project progress via dates and descriptions).
- **Survey and SOW tickets (2376701, 2380335)** both include required drop counts and rack quantities for installers.
- **Shipping ticket (2376735)** aligns with the install’s planned hardware inventory.
- **Service interruptions:**  
  - Bad weather (snowstorm) directly impacts field service schedule and site readiness.
  - “Pending reschedule” posts indicate live projects are delayed—not complete cancellations.
- **Accounting/Billing barrier:**  
  - Transition to billing is held “on hold” until site work is confirmed as complete.
