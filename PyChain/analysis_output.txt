## 2. Relationship Map

Below is a logical mapping of the relationships, denoting which **DISPATCH** tickets directly led to which **TURNUP** tickets. SHIPPING tickets are noted where relevant.

**Phase/Function | Dispatch Ticket(s) -> Turnup Ticket(s) | Shipping Ticket(s)**
--- | --- | ---
**Site Survey** | 2382273 ("Site Survey" dispatch, created 2/6) -> 2384311 (site survey turnup 2/11/2025) | 2371009, 2376745 (prior to on-site work)
**Phase 1 (Cabling)** | 2382345 ("P1" dispatch 2/6) -> 2385133 (hardware-wiring turnup 2/17/2025) | 
**Phase 2 (VPN Install/Cutover)** | 2382393 ("P2" dispatch 2/6) -> 2385481 (VPN install turnup 2/18/2025), and possibly open turnup 2372208 | 
**Turnup Assist/Coordination** | 2371027 & 2376840 (dispatches 1/15 and 1/28)—advisory, referencing core events above—not direct to a turnup, but management/assist for cutover event | 
**Contractor/Acct (FST Accounting)** | 2385730, 2389531, 2393017, 2397208, 2424153, 2424181: These dispatch FST accounting records **track labor/hours/costs** for the above Turnup tickets, using "Turn Up #:" references to match up to turnup ticket IDs. | 
**Revisit 1/Electrician** | 2387583 (dispatch 2/17)—no turnup ticket directly associated (possibly overlaps/superseded by P2, or was a canceled/tripalicate) | 
**Revisit 2** | 2390070 (dispatch 2/21) -> 2390086 (turnup 3/4, completed), accounting entry in 2397208 | 
**Revisit 3** | 2399922 (dispatch 3/11, on hold) -> 2413627 (turnup 4/9/2025)—marked "On Hold", not completed, with accounting attempts in 2424153, 2424181 (0 hours/pay) | 
**Billing/Milestone** | 2400838 (dispatch 3/12): Billing milestone; not linked to a turnup but to project progress.

## 3. Anomalies/Issues

1. **Dispatch-to-Turnup 1:1 Broken:**  
   - Several dispatch tickets were "advisory" or project-management (i.e., Turnup Assist, Accounting, Billing), breaking the presumed 1:1 relationship with Turnup tickets.
   - At every work phase (survey, cabling, VPN), multiple dispatch tickets reference the same on-site event.

2. **Duplicated and Parallel Dispatches:**  
   - "Revisit" tickets (for both dispatch and turnup) indicate rework and/or troubleshooting loops, leading to parallel and repeated tickets for essentially the same phase.

3. **Open/Unresolved Turnup:**  
   - Turnup Ticket 2372208 was created (2/18/2025) but lacks posts and is never closed—likely an artifact or placeholder.

4. **Accounting/Contractor Entries as Dispatch Tickets:**  
   - Several dispatch tickets are logging time/pay (not actual service dispatch)—may pollute reporting/analytics in systems expecting a strict dispatch->turnup mapping.

5. **Revisit 3 Never Completed:**  
   - The final phase (Revisit 3, Turnup 2413627) was scheduled, set to On Hold, and never completed despite contractor records for attempt/time with zero hours/pay.

6. **Inconsistent Use of Site Number:**  
   - Some dispatch/turnup tickets use “Site Number: FW001840,” others just “1840,” which could cause confusion or mismatches in automation.

7. **Service Dates Defaulted:**  
   - Several service dates default to 1969-12-31—a sign of incomplete/malformed ticket data.

  - Project began with pre-planning, shipping of materials, and the scheduling of a site survey.  
  - A turnup was executed on 2/11/2025 to survey the environment.

- **Main Work:**  
  - Subsequent main cabling ("Phase 1") and VPN installation ("Phase 2") were scheduled and performed mid-February, supported by corresponding dispatches and on-site visits by technician David Fisher.
