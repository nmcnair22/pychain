Certainly! Below is a comprehensive analysis of relationships, workflow linkages, and extracted implementation details across the provided ticket chain (**hash B924DF9C-E1B9-B945-8442-89CE8F62A268**) for site FW008350 (Wendy’s Hagerstown, MD). The analysis covers parent-child structures, workflow flows (dispatch/turnup/billing), and key project execution details extracted from posts and notes.

---

## **1. Parent-Child Relationships**
- **No explicit parent-child relationships** are established in this dataset via the `linked_tickets` field (all are empty arrays).
- **However**, strong *logical* parent-child relationships exist, inferred from subjects, project IDs, and posts:
  - Site Survey → Cabling/Build project → Turnup/Dispatch → Billing
  - Phasing also present (P1, P2, etc.)

---

## **2. Workflow Linkages: Dispatch–Turnup–Billing**

### **A. Survey & Initial Scope**
- **2380335** *(Hardware-Wiring: Survey 2/4/2025)*  
  - **Posts:**  
    - Cable drop count: “28 cable runs needed. 1 additional cable run may be required for a label printer.” (Post 15529744)
    - Racks: “2 racks to be installed.”
    - Power: “A power outlet is needed at the new rack location.”
    - Completion: “Tech completed the site survey successfully… will submit survey results…” *(Post 15529744/15529755)*
  - Survey results directly reference the cabling/upgrade SOW.

### **B. Project Scope / Cabling**
- **2376701** *(Hardware-Wiring: Cabling and Network Upgrade Project Scope)*  
  - **Posts**:  
    - Extremely detailed SOW: multiple “Install Qty. X – Siemon Cat 6 Non-Plenum Cables…” (see 'Cable Drop Counts' summary below).
    - Closure: “Closing… part of clean-up” (Post 15545493).
    - Drop counts: Matches survey—confirming SOW generation from survey results.
    - Status: **Closed**
- **2380336** *(Turnup Assist Ticket 2/12)*  
  - Duplicates SOW from above; reflects turnup scheduling derived from the cabling scope.
  - Closure: “Closing – ticket is part of clean-up.” (Post 15545624)
  - Status: **Closed**

### **C. Dispatch and Turnup Coordination**
- **2376830** *(Turnup Assist Request)*  
  - Scope: “Network cutover job to happen on day 2 of a cabling project… arrange a remote resource…” (Post 15501291)
  - Closure: “Closing as clean up efforts of 2/6/2025” (Post 15545161)
  - Status: **Closed**
- **2382265** *(Site Survey, Pro Services)*  
  - Survey: “Survey completed 2/4…Tech info: Joel (240) 888-7239” (Post 15548254)
  - Cross-ref note: "https://staff.cissdm.com/ticketing/ticket/2380335" in Notes—**indicating chain linkage**.
  - Status: **Confirmed**
- **2382333** *(P1 Phase 1, Hardware-Wiring, Pro Services)*  
  - Scheduling: Multiple techs assigned (“P1 dispatch on 2/11”, “Tech tonight: Aaron Blackburn 215-771-8788” in Posts 15548726, 15563030).
  - **Note:** "On hold per Lucas" (Indicates a delay/pause in execution).
  - Status: **On Hold**

### **D. Site Hardware/Shipping**
- **2376735** *(General, Outbound – Shipping)*
  - Ships hardware for site: list **hardware quantities** in opening post (1 router, 2 switches, 2 APs, 1 Extender, 1 SIM, 4 SFP's).
  - Tracking: UPS 1ZA636Y90242932124 delivered on 2/12 at 10:51 AM.
  - Status: **Delivered**

### **E. Outlet and Repairs (Power, Miscellaneous)**
- **2384350, 2385184** *(Outlet Install)*
  - Electrical work scheduled ("Outlet Install", Tech: Dahan Electric).
  - **2385184**: Attempted, *failed*—"Reschedule needed for tomorrow" (Post 15572189), status **Failed**
  - **2384350**: Status **Scheduled**
  - Scheduling & reschedules point to dependencies on electrical readiness.

### **F. Cabling/Turnup Phases**
- **2382726 (P1)**: Scheduled for 2/11; *failed due to snow storm* (Post 15563616).  
  - Note: Multiple techs (Ritchie, then Aaron Blackburn).
  - Status: **Failed**

  - Status: **Cancelled - CIS**

### **G. Billing/Financial Closure**
- **2401881** *(50% Billing)*

  - Note: Cost breakdown (Note 648860): “Full cabling sites - 3 night model ($5016+$460)… Site survey $75… PM $25… Remote turn up $200… Total $3,268.00”
  - Status: **On Hold**

---

## **3. Orphaned or Unlinked Records**
- No orphan tickets at the technical level (all tickets reference the same project/site and workflow).
- All `linked_tickets` fields empty, so *explicit system-level linkage* is missing.
- **Logical linkage** is established via:
  - Site number, subject line, referenced ticket URLs/POs.
  - Survey → SOW → Turnups → Shipping → Outlet → Billing.

## **7. Synthesis**
- **Workflow Sequence:**  
  Survey (2380335, 2382265) → Scope/Design (2376701, 2380336) → Dispatch/Shipping (2376830, 2376735) → Physical Install/Phasing (2382333, 2382726, 2382746, 2389439, 2389461) → Misc. Site Needs (2384350, 2385184) → Billing (2401881, 2402063)
- **Most delays/revisits** are in the *field turnup/installation* and *outlet install* due to weather and notification issues.
- **No tickets are truly “orphaned,”** but all rely on logical (not system-enforced) cross-referencing.
- *Completion/closure* cycles are repeated (especially for clean-up or rework).
- The **turnup/install phases** are repeatedly rescheduled (weather and communication issues, as directly cited in ticket posts/notes).
