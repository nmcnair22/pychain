Here’s a comprehensive analysis of the ticket chain related to ticket 2380335, addressing your specific requests:

---

## 1. Parent-Child Relationships (linked_tickets)

**Summary:**
- **No explicit parent-child relationships.**  
  - The `linked_tickets` field in all records is empty.
  - All tickets are part of the same chain (common `chain_hash`), but formally, each is an individual record without direct system-level linkage.

---

## 2. Dispatch-Turnup-Billing Linkages

We infer relationships thematically and by chronology, as formal linkage is missing.

### **A. Dispatch to Turnup**

- **2376830 (Turnup Assist Request):**  
  - _Initial dispatch ticket_: Calls for remote resources for a network cutover.
  - **Closeout post**: "Closing as clean up efforts of 2/6/2025".

- **2376701 (Cabling/Network Upgrade Project Management):**  
  - _Project-level overview_, including detailed cable schedule and demarcation of responsibilities.
  - **Closed** as part of clean-up (2/6/2025).

- **Discovery/Survey tickets:**  
  - **2380335** ("SURVEY 2/4/2025 11:30 AM"):  
    - Work completed, with cable run counts and site notes.
    - _Links in post_ to **2376701** for further detail, indicates process continuity.
    - **Completion status**: "Completed" & "closed".
    - **Cable runs:** 28 needed, plus one more possible for label printer.

  - **2382265** ("Site Survey, SCOPE OF WORK: Site Survey"):  
    - Survey completed 2/4; same tech Joel listed here and in 2380335.
    - **Note** links to 2380335 for continuity.

- **Shipping/Installation Prep:**  
  - **2376735 (Shipping Outbound)**:  
    - Hardware prepared and delivered (detailed hardware and delivery times).
    - "Did not ship, until Monday..." indicates initial shipping delay.

### **B. Turnup/Install Phases**

- **Phase 1 – Multiple Tickets:**
  - **2382333 (P1)*, 2382726 (P1), 2389439 (P1)**:  
    - Show scheduling, resource assignments, but **five tickets are On Hold, Failed, or Cancelled**—indicating repeated delays/reschedules on this project.
    - **Delays** captured in posts: "On hold per Lucas", "Cancelled due to snow storm", and "pending reschedule".

  - **Technicians:** Several named: Ritchie, Aaron Blackburn.

- **Phase 2 – Multiple Tickets:**
  - **2382746 (P2), 2389461 (P2)**:  
    - _Both Cancelled_ – site not notified, pending reschedule.

- **Outlet Install Tickets:**
  - **2384350** (Scheduled, with almost no commentary — likely not completed).
  - **2385184** (Failed; notes indicate reschedule required, "will be needed for tomorrow").

---

### **C. Billing Linkage**

- **2401881 ("50 PERCENT BILLING")** and **2402063 ("Billing Complete Ticket")**:
  - Both reference Coupa invoices and POs.
  - **2402063 note gives cost breakdown**:
    - "Full cabling sites - 3 night model ($5016+$460) $2,508.00"
    - "Site survey $75"
    - "Engineering/PM $25"
    - "Remote turn up services $200"
    - "Total $3,268.00"

  - These are logically the "end of chain" regarding financials, referencing prior scope, work delivery, and survey/turnup records.

---

## 3. Orphaned or Unlinked Records

- **All tickets lack system-linked parent/child reference**; they are "thematically" linked (shared site, chain_hash, and notes/internal links).
- **Orphaned in the sense of lacking formal system linkage**, but posts and notes demonstrate procedural linkage.
- Example: **2382265** has a note linking to 2380335, but via comment, not system field.
