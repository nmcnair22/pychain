Here’s a detailed relationship and data extraction analysis for the ticket chain **B924DF9C-E1B9-B945-8442-89CE8F62A268** (15 tickets, starting with ticket 2380335):

---

## 1. **Parent-Child Relationships**

There are **NO parent-child (linked ticket)** records explicitly present—**the `linked_tickets` field is empty throughout**. All relationships are thus implicit, inferred through subject lines, posts, project IDs, site numbers, and categorical sequences (survey > hardware wiring > turnup > billing, etc).

# **Conclusion**
- **No explicit parent-child (linked_tickets) links, but clear workflow sequence:** Project Scope → Survey → Shipping/Outbound → Turnup/Hardware Wiring → Outlet Install/Repair → Billing.
- **Cable drops and hardware requirements well documented in scope/survey (2376701, 2380335, 2380336).**
- **Multiple phases scheduled, many cancelled or failed due to external factors (weather, project hold, lack of site prep).**
- **Bills are tied to project completion status, with clear amounts and split invoicing (2401881/2402063).**
- **Essential revisit/reschedule requirements are documented, especially for P1/P2 turnups and outlet installs.**
- **Some items (outlet, cable drops) impede project flow, requiring corrective dispatches and multiple attempted completions.**
