### CHAIN ANALYSIS: B924DF9C-E1B9-B945-8442-89CE8F62A268  
#### Overview

- **Total Tickets:** 15
- **Primary Location:** Flynn/Wendy’s FW008350, Hagerstown, MD (site #8350, sometimes noted as "Wendys FW008350")
- **Project:** Network/cabling upgrade with phased field service work: site survey → hardware/wiring (turnup) → cutover, repair, (re)scheduling, and billing.
- **Parent-Child Relationships (linked_tickets):** **None** explicitly set (all tickets show `"linked_tickets": []`) – relationships inferred from subject lines, post content, and notes.
- **Ticket IDs of Focus:** 2376701, 2376735, 2376830, 2380335, 2380336, 2382265, 2382333, 2382726, 2382746, 2384350, 2385184, 2389439, 2389461, 2401881, 2402063.

---

## 1. **Parent-Child Relationships**

All tickets in this chain have **empty `linked_tickets` fields**; thus, there are **no system-designated parents or children**. However, logical relationships can be deduced based on chronology, ticket type, site number, and referencing notes/posts.

- **"Survey" precedes Turnup, Shipping, and Repair/Install events.**
- **Billing tickets (2401881, 2402063) reference site/project phases completed by other tickets.**

---

## 2. **Dispatch, Turnup, Billing Linkages**

### **A. Dispatch/Site Survey → Turnup/Install/Repair → Billing**

    - *Scope* lists quantities for each cable drop and device:
        - “28 cable runs needed. 1 additional cable run may be required for a label printer.”
        - “2 racks to be installed.”
        - “A power outlet is needed at the new rack location.”
        - "No obstructions identified. ISP Circuit: Technician was unable to locate the ISP circuit."

    - **Status:** "Closed" as part of clean-up ("Closing - ticket is part of clean-up.", post 15545493)

**Survey tickets** logically **parent to the implementation tickets**, but not linked in-system.

    - **Status:** On Hold

**Logical linkage:**  
- Billing tickets clearly reference the completion of the implementation/turnup work across several other tickets.

---

## 3. **Orphaned or Unlinked Records**

- **No orphaned tickets relative to the project**: All tickets use a consistent subject/SOW format, are for the same site, same project(s), and are sequential in the chain with consistent site/customer identifiers.
- **Systemically unlinked**: *All tickets show `linked_tickets: []`*. Linkages are informal (via notes/cross-references in posts).

#### **Examples of Cross-referencing:**

- **In 2382265 note 647147:** "https://staff.cissdm.com/ticketing/ticket/2380335"
- **In 2380335 post 15529744/15529755**: Links to 2376701 ticket URL.

## 6. **Notable Patterns and Observations**

- **No formal (linked_tickets) parent-child relationships; project managed via cross-references in posts/notes and subject lines.**
- **Dispatch/turnup/billing sequence followed**
    - Survey → Turnup/Install attempts (some failed/delayed) → Billing tickets open upon (attempted) completion.
    - Many implementation attempts failed/cancelled due to weather, notification failures, or scheduling/tech mix-ups.
- **Cable drop and hardware specifics extremely consistent across SOWs in all survey/planning tickets**; only small site-specific changes (e.g., one mentions 28 drops, another “more drops for a printer possible”).
- **Implementation and some repair attempts frequently ended in failed/cancelled tickets. Several explicit needs for revisit/reschedule.**
    - E.g.: 2382726 (snow), 2385184 (reschedule needed), 2389439/2389461 (pending reschedule).
- **Billing tickets are dependent upon closure/completion of install phase**; detailed itemizations indicate anticipated work but the actual field execution experienced multiple setbacks.
- **No unassigned or orphaned records relative to the project context, but all are technically “unlinked” in the system.**

---

## 7. **Key Quotes (with Ticket ID references):**

- **Cable drop count (2380335, post 15529744):**    
    > "28 cable runs needed. 1 additional cable run may be required for a label printer."
    > "2 racks to be installed."
- **Closure/completion (2376830, post 15545161):**
    > "Closing as clean up efforts of 2/6/2025"
- **Reschedule/pending (2385184, post 15572189):**
    > "Reschedule will be needed for tomorrow. Time to be determined later tonight."
- **Delays (2376735, post 15551764):**
    > "This did not ship out, until monday will be going out"
- **Revisit/notification issues (2389439/2389461, posts 15618298, 15618300):**
    > "This site is pending reschedule. The site has not been notified of the install and will not be expecting a technician, please update your schedule accordingly."
- **On Hold reason (2382333, note 647142):**
    > "On hold per Lucas"
- **Billing details (2402063, note 648860):**
    > "Full cabling sites - 3 night model ($5016+$460) ... Site survey $75 ... Engineering/PM $25 ... Remote turn up $200 ... Total $3,268.00"

---

## **Conclusion**

- The chain represents a **full field service project lifecycle** (survey → implementation → billing) for a cabling/network upgrade at a single site, **heavily impacted by logistics and operational issues** (weather, scheduling, communication, shipment delays).
- **All relationships are inferred** from posts, notes, and subject lines, **not system-linked**.
- **No record is truly orphaned**, but technical relationships are informal; **cross-reference notes/posts serve as linkage**.
- **Cable and install SOWs are meticulously documented across the project**; field execution was **fragmented due to external circumstances**.
- **Billing ultimately anticipated successful completion, but multiple tickets indicate revisit and rescheduling needs due to failures and cancellations**.
