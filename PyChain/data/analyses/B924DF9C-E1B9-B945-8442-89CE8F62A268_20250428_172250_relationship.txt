---

# 1. Parent-Child Relationships
- **Linked Tickets:**  
  - All tickets in this chain have **empty `linked_tickets` fields**.  
  - **Conclusion:** There are **no explicit parent-child relationships**—no ticket directly references another as a parent or child via system linkages.

---

# 2. Workflow Linkages (Dispatch → Turnup → Billing)

There is a clear operational flow, with separate ticket types aligning to **project phases**: Site Survey/Prep, Hardware Install/Turnup, Outlet/Power, and Billing.

### **Field Service Process:**

| Type        | Examples (Ticket ID – Subject)   | Status         | Key Details |
|-------------|----------------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Project Scope/Site Survey** | 2380335 – Survey 2/4/2025<br>2382265 – Site Survey | Completed/Confirmed | Site requirements, cable counts |
| **Prep/Shipping** | 2376735 – Outbound<br>2384350, 2385184 – Outlet Install | Delivered, Scheduled, Failed | Shipping delays, outlet install req. |
| **Turnup/Cutover** | 2376830, 2380336, 2382333, 2382726, 2382746, 2389439, 2389461 | Closed, On Hold, Cancelled, Failed | Cleanups, holds, failed (weather) |
| **Billing** | 2401881, 2402063 | On Hold | Partial and final invoice |
| **Other/Project Mgmt** | 2376701 – Network Upgrade | Closed | Full SOW with cable drops |

**Relational Flow:**  
- **Surveys (2380335/2382265)** → **Survey Results and Cable Drop Counts** → **Turnup and Prep Dispatches (Turnup Assist, Hardware Installs, Outlet Installs, etc.)** → **Completion/Failures/Reschedules** → **Billing**
- Each "Phase" or activity may be managed in its **own ticket** rather than strictly chained as parent/child, but **temporal and process flow is consistent**.

---

# 3. Orphaned or Unlinked Records

- **All records are functionally related by subject/project,** but:
  - Orphaned: **No ticket is formally linked to another as a parent/child in the system.**
  - Unlinked: Each ticket stands alone from a system perspective, but **staff notes and ticket content clearly reference each other** (e.g., note in ticket 2382265 links URL for 2380335).
